# Intro
Interpreter to make your Iambic Paddle a USB keyboard input. This means that you can send your computer morse code and it will type the respective characters on screen. This is a great project for those trying to increase their code speed and getting some practice in.

# Original Idea
Full credit for the design on this goes to these guys:  https://trmm.net/Morse_Code_keyboard/

This is forked from TemporarilyOffline/usb-paddle because I plan on drastically changing the setup to include external pots and allowing the teensy to play as an input audio device to the computer. Eventually I will also make a fork for the Raspberry Pi Pico in order to make this project more accessible.

# Improvements over usb-paddle

Improvements include two external pots for code speed and pitch. There will also be a mute switch and a lock switch. Mute will mute the speaker but will still allow the tone to play through the PC audio input. This means that you can listen to your code through the PC using headphones while you're dit-ting away. The lock switch will lock changes made with the pots in the event something brushes up against them or if you want to take this module portable. I plan on trying it with my iPad and iPhone and I'll update this page with testing.

# Build

Right now everything is spread out on my workbench. The plan is to fit this all in an Altoids Arctic 1.2oz tin.
